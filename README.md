Credit Card Fraud Detection
============================
Using the k-means clustering algorithm the minisom module gives a SOM as output. 
Analysing the map certain outliers can be identified and such differentiation allows us
to predict the possibility of another person committing fraud. Using the data from the map
an ANN is stacked and probabilty that a customer being fraudster is obtained
